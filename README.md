# credit-risk-classification
For this Challenge, using various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. By using a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
The methods used Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data, and Logistic Regression Model with the Resampled training data. 

 Machine Learning Model 1 (Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data):
 Accuracy: 0.95
 Precision: (healthy loan: 1.00), (high-risk loan: 0.85)
 Recall: (healthy loan: 0.99), (high-risk loan: 0.91)

Machine Learning Model 2 (Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data):
Accuracy: 0.99
Precision: (healthy loan: 0.99), (high-risk loan: 0.99)
Recall: (healthy loan: 0.99), (high-risk loan:  0.99)

Both machine learning models had high accuracies, but I would recommend Logistic Regression model with resampled training data because that machine learning model worked the best. Since that model provided with the highest prediction accuaracy.
